  # L is the characteristic dimension, usually the vertical dimension.  For reference, 
  # a cylinder's characteristic L would be its height, assuming it is standing on its end
  # Units of L should be in metres
  # This L should be the same L as is used for the convective coefficient calculation
  # Ts is the surface temperature
  # Ta is the ambient temperature
  # v2 is the kinematic viscosity squared
